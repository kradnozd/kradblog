```python
> print("Hello world!")
```

My name is Tung Le, also known with the nickname *"Krad"*. I've worked as a 👾 game designer, 💻 web developer, 📐 graphic designer, 📷 photographer and currently on the road to become an artist and indie game developer. I'm also a gamer, writer, dreamer and ...I don't know. May be I'm not an expert in any particular field, I just simply do things.
